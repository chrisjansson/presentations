# Why
This example tries to demonstrate how bugs can hide in code with unecessary side effects and how they can be surfaced by refactoring to a functional style.

# How to
Run the tests, fix the bugs. Try to refactor towards a functional style and see if the bugs can even exist in that style of code.

*A refactored example is found in the **refactored** directory.*
